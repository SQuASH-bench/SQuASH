# Evaluation Scripts for GNN-based Quantum Circuit Regression

## Overview

This repository contains scripts to evaluate the performance of pretrained Graph Neural Network (GNN) models on quantum circuit datasets. The scripts focus on:
- **Evaluating individual quantum circuits**.
- **Evaluating the entire dataset** for regression tasks.
- **Generating evaluation metrics** and visualizations.
